Tensor Flow 

Everything in tensor flow works on a takes place in graph and running and evaluating uses a session. 

Computation steps in Tensorflow
1) create a tf tensor - > which defines the operation that you want to compute
2) by default the tensor will be added to the default graph 
3) create a session 
4) run the session to compute the operation 

example: 
y = tf.add(675,325)
g = tf.get_default_graph()
[op.name for op in g.get_operations()]
g.get_tensor_by_name('Add'+':0')
sess = tf.Session() 
computed_y = y.eval(session=sess)
computed_y
sess.close()

#create a interactive session 
sess = tf.InteractiveSession()
x.eval()   # this way we can speeden up the process 


An image kernel is a small matrix used to apply effects like the ones you might find in Photoshop or Gimp, 
such as blurring, sharpening, outlining or embossing. They're also used in machine learning for 'feature extraction', 
a technique for determining the most important portions of an image. 

How an image kernal works : 

3x3 block of pixels in the image on the left, 
we multiply each pixel by the corresponding entry of the kernel and then take the sum.
That sum becomes a new pixel in the image on the right.
