Tensor Flow 

Everything in tensor flow works on a computational graph -> with a


An image kernel is a small matrix used to apply effects like the ones you might find in Photoshop or Gimp, 
such as blurring, sharpening, outlining or embossing. They're also used in machine learning for 'feature extraction', 
a technique for determining the most important portions of an image. 

How an image kernal works : 

3x3 block of pixels in the image on the left, 
we multiply each pixel by the corresponding entry of the kernel and then take the sum.
That sum becomes a new pixel in the image on the right.
